Welcome to my _new blog_!  I started out this blog by following a nice [Astro blog tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/).  The blog content is stored in [GitHub](https://github.com/johnp789/astro-blog) and published to [CloudFlare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

## What I like

1. **Learning Astro**: The blog tutorial was excellent.  It covered all the things I wanted to see.

2. **Making Pages**: Markdown is pretty nice.  Having the whole blog site come together using frontmatter and Javascript is slick.

3. **Site Performance**: So far, the blog site scores well on Chrome Lighthouse and feels fast.

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
