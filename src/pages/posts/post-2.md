These are some web games I enjoy.

1. [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle) is a classic.  I'm on a 21-day streak right now, with a max streak of 70 days.

1. [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/) is very good.

1. [Connections](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections) is fun!

1. [Strands](https://www.nytimes.com/games/strands) is a new game from The New York Times, currently marked beta.

1. [GeoGrid](https://www.geogridgame.com/) I find a bit harder than the others, but I have only played it a few times.

1. [Planarity](https://www.jasondavies.com/planarity/) is habit-forming in a good way.
